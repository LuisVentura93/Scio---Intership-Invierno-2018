            <img src="assets/img/Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.jpg" id="disc" alt="">
            <p>Prior to recording Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, Anthony Gonzalez had moved from his native France to Los Angeles. 
                Describing the move in an interview, Gonzalez said: "Having spent 29 years of my life in France, 
                I moved to California a year and a half before the making of this album and I was excited and inspired by so many different things: 
                by the landscape, by the way of life, by live shows, by movies, by the road trips I took alone...</p>

            <img src="assets/img/21.jpg" id="disc" alt="">
            <p>Writing for the album began shortly after Adele separated from her lover. Within a day of her break-up, she contacted producer Paul Epworth, 
                intent on capturing her emotion in a song: "We'd had a fuming argument the night before ... 
                I'd been bubbling. Then I went into the studio and screamed."</p>

            <p>Harvey began writing lyrics for the album before setting the words to music. She has cited the poetry of Harold Pinter 
                and T.S. Eliot as influences, as well as the artwork of Salvador Dalí and Francisco de Goya and music of The Doors, 
                The Pogues, and The Velvet Underground.[6] She has also spoken of researching the history of conflict, including
                 the Gallipoli Campaign, and reading modern-day testimonies from civilians and soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

            <h3>St. Vincent - Strange Mercy</h3><br><br>
            <img src="assets/img/Strange Mercy.jpg" id="disc" alt=""> 
            <p>Strange Mercy was described as being more personal than previous St. Vincent albums. "Chloe in the Afternoon", 
                the album's opener, explores Clark's misgivings about monogamy, particularly the societal pressures on and assumptions 
                about human relationships. The lyrics "Best, finest surgeon. Come cut me open" in the track "Surgeon" were 
                taken from a line written in Marilyn Monroe's journal. Clark found that line to be "brilliant and really
                strange", saying "And I was – I put, you know, inspiration from my own life for various situational 
                depression or what – call it what you will.</p>

            <img src="assets/img/Bon Iver, Bon Iver.jpg" id="disc" alt="">
            <p>Bon Iver's second album was rumored to be titled Letters for Marvin but was later confirmed to be Bon Iver. 
               "I brought in a lot of people to change my voice – not my singing voice, but my role as the author of this band, 
               this project," said Justin Vernon, band leader and founder, who hired well-known players like bass saxophonist 
               Colin Stetson and pedal-steel guitarist Greg Leisz. "I built the record myself, but I allowed those people to 
               come in and change the scene." The second album is described as an "ambitious musical departure" from the first.</p>

            <img src="assets/img/Helplessness Blues.jpg" id="disc" alt="">        
            <p>Pecknold has come out saying for their second album he tried to sound "less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based". 
                Taking inspiration from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, or at least its 12-string guitar he said: "That will be 
                the primary sonic distancing from the last record". Added to this, he stated they wanted to record very quickly, 
                saying he wanted to do the "vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want 
                there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. </p>
